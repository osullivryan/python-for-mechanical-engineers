# Welcome to Python for Mechanical Engineers

This is a collection of tips, tricks, and thoughts on how to use Python in your daily Mechanical Engineering career when you didn't go to school for it in the first place.

!!! summary
    I'm writing these documents as if I'm creating a new package, `simplebeamcalculator`, from complete scratch on a new laptop. This should let you skip around to what you need and hopefully help you improve your local, or teams, development and deployment.

!!! warning
    Some of the environment setup steps are going to seem long, especially if it's your first time doing this. However, I wrote this in a way where you will only need to do this one time. Overall I think it will take you about 30 minutes to complete the environment setup.

## Some Assumptions

I make some assumptions about your environment and working structure that might not apply to everyone, but are certainly general enough for most. **If you don't meet all of the assumptions that doesn't mean you can't follow this guide!** The basics are that you:

1. Are working in Windows 10.
2. Are going to be using Python ^3.8. ^3.9 is preferred. 
3. Have some sort of access to git (either through your work/school or through Github/Gitlab public).
4. Have some patience. If you're accustomed to using excel, matlab, subversion, etc some of these steps might seem foreign. You'll get it though!
